# Feature Specifications - Football Scouting Platform

This document provides detailed specifications for all features in the Football Scouting Platform, organized by user type and development phase.

## Phase 1: Enhanced MVP with Level Assessment Flow (Weeks 1-3)

### 1.0 New User Onboarding & Level Assessment Flow

#### Complete User Journey - From Registration to Level Assignment
**Flow Overview:**
```
Registration → Profile Setup → Assessment Challenges → Video Upload → Level Assignment → Level Dashboard
```

#### Step 1: Basic Registration
- **Feature**: Standard email/password registration
- **Data Collected**: Email, password, first name, last name
- **Next Step**: Redirect to profile setup

#### Step 2: Extended Profile Setup
- **Feature**: Football-specific profile completion
- **Required Data**:
  - Age (determines age group and appropriate challenges)
  - Primary position (striker, midfielder, defender, goalkeeper)
  - Dominant foot (right, left, both)
  - Years playing football (0-1, 2-5, 6-10, 10+ years)
  - Previous club/team experience (optional)
  - Height and weight (optional but recommended)
- **UI/UX**: Step-by-step wizard with position-specific graphics
- **Validation**: Age-appropriate position validation (no 8-year-old goalkeepers)

#### Step 3: Generic Assessment Challenge Presentation
- **Feature**: Present the same standardized set of 5 assessment challenges to ALL users
- **Standardized Challenge Set**:
  - **Ball Control**: Basic touch and control measurement
  - **Short Passing**: 20 passes to target accuracy test
  - **Shooting Accuracy**: 10 shots on target measurement
  - **Basic Dribbling**: Cone weaving time and technique assessment
  - **Sprint Speed**: 30-meter sprint timing
- **UI**: Present challenges with clear instructions and demo videos
- **User Choice**: Player can complete challenges in any order they prefer
- **Benefits**: Consistent baseline for all players, easier score comparison

#### Step 4: Video + Performance Data Submission
- **Feature**: For each assessment challenge, collect both video and performance metrics
- **Video Upload**:
  - Record attempt at challenge (30-90 seconds max)
  - Multiple attempts allowed, submit best one
  - Basic video validation (format, length, file size)
- **Performance Data Entry**:
  - **Example - Shooting Accuracy**: "How many shots out of 10 hit the target?"
  - **Example - Passing**: "How many passes out of 20 reached teammate accurately?"
  - **Example - Ball Control**: "How many touches to control 10 balls?"
  - **Example - Sprint**: "Time for 30-meter sprint (seconds)"
- **Data Validation**: Reasonable range validation (can't have 100% accuracy on first assessment)

#### Step 5: Level Determination Algorithm
- **Feature**: Automated analysis combines video review + performance data to assign starting level
- **Scoring Algorithm**:
  - Each challenge scored 1-10 based on performance metrics
  - Video analysis provides technique score 1-10
